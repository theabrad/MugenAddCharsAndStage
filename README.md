This is a little script I wrote in Python to be able to add characters and stages in the 2D fighting game M.U.G.E.N with the click of a mouse.
To add characters place the character folder in the "chars" directory. To add stages place the stage files in the "stages" directory.
Once the new characters and stages are placed in their respective folders, place this script in the main MUGEN directory.(The one with the .exe file in it) and click.
